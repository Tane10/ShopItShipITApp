## The App:
ShopIt ShipIt is a React native Android app that allows a user to take a picture of a item of clothing, add details such as price, name, then add item to their basket and buy or sell. 

## The API:
The API is created using NodeJs. This for local testing and dev I will be using ngork as local host this will allow fast and easy dev before hosting the API on Herku. The API will only have basic functions such as Get, Post and maybe a Put.

## Testing:
This project was created using a BDD approach. The is to create a neat and fast test suite that has good code coverage. Doing it this way allows tests to be done as we go along, slightly increase over all dev time but allowing a more stable and tested product.
